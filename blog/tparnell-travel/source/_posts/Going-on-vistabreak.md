13 days is how long I have been on my travels so far. Incase you don't know what a vistabreak is, it is a 4 week time off you get at vistaprint every 5 years. This year is my 5th year.

My holiday began on the First of August, and I immediately took off to the UK. Most of my family live in an area of the UK knwon as Ellesmere Port. After 7 hours of traveling I arrived August 2nd. Tired and jetlagged I spent the first few days relaxing, and eating at Asda (a nearby supermarket).

## Chester

Chester a nearby city, that was founded by the romans in 79 AD, was my first major destination. I walked around the busy victorian streets, and was gobsmacked. Where once stood old british stores, now stood American names such as Vans, and Banana Republic. Since the last time I was in England, American consumerism has taken hold. The hearts and minds of people in the UK, now rest in Western influences, and less upon the heritage of England. 

As I walked around the city I couldn't help but take in the beauty of the Victorian buildings, and the Roman walls. The scenery was stunning, and the history was mind boggling. I took a boat down the Dee river, and I was able to see where witches were forcably drowned in the middle ages.

## Whats next?

I plan on visting the [Pontcysyllte Aqueduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontcysyllte_Aqueduct), and other parts of wales. I am near liverpool, so I have to go to the [Albert dock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Dock). My grandfather has made me promise to go to the beatles museaum with him. 

I also plan on taking pictures of my old school, and the town I lived in as a child. I havn't blogged much as I have been very busy catching up with family. I plan on starting to kick up blogging more, so stay tuned.
